rgm_score_sort - Rog-O-Matic was a program which automated playing the game
                 Rogue. Convinced that I would break the record high score,
                 I wrote this utility to sort its output. Realizing that if I
                 did break the record, no one would actually care, I repurposed
                 that raspberry pi for more useful endevours.

geometry - Geometric area calculator.

discrete_math - A handful of utilities I made for projects back when I was
                taking discrete.
