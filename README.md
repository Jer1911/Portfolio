# Portfolio - Jeremy Ecker

This repository contains code taken from my private repositories, in order to
provide employers with a representative sample of different types of
applications I have written and contributed to.

The code is organized into folders based on discipline:

MAZEFIGHTER - Javascript game based on RotJS. This is a work in progress and
likely to change frequently.

WEB_DEV_DEVOPS_AUTOMATION - An example of a project I successfully completed and deployed at my current job.

FlaskDynamoDB - Software Engineering school project contribution.

COMPUTER_VISION - Examples of computer vision applications in matlab, university coursework

ARM - Simulator of the effects of a subset of ARM (Leg v8) instructions written
in Python, Computer Architecture university coursework

DATA_STRUCTURES -
  - ACC_2415 - Austin Community College Data Structures coursework (we took a distinctly different, more modern approach)
  - TX_State_Uni_3358 - Texas State University Data Structures coursework (the university counted transfer credits in a strange way,
    so it was necessary to take surplus data structures course).

OOP - Object-Oriented Programming in Java, university coursework

PYTHON - Samples of useful Python programs I have written

CPP - Samples of useful C++ programs I have written
