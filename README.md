# Portfolio - Jeremy Ecker

Note: The old portfolio has been retired; it was time. For the curious, you can
check it out by looking at earlier commits.

**Welcome to the NEW portfolio!**

I am focused these days on Python and Flask web applications. I own and operate
a small consulting business (Jerhub) where that is what I do. In my (rare) spare
time, I have been writing a tutorial series focused on showing people how to
accomplish specific tasks with Flask that are common, but also difficult to
locate solid tutorials on. This should serve to inform prospective clients and
employers on a subset of my abilities, and a demonstration of understanding of
essential concepts.
