# Portfolio - Jeremy Ecker

This repository contains code taken from my private repositories, in order to
provide employers with a representative sample of different types of
applications I have written and contributed to.

portfolio_old - Contains my old portfolio, mostly college work and a few other
bits and bobs. Here you will find a mix of languages: Javascript, C++, Python,
PHP, HTML, etc.

portfolio_new - Contains more current samples, mostly Python + Flask application
excerpts.
