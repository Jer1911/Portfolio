# Mazefighter - A Javascript quasi-Roguelike game

Play the game online here:
http://jerhub.com/mazefighter.html

This is a pet project I have been developing in order to hone my Javascript
skills. The code in this Portfolio repository may not reflect the current
code in the online playable demo. This code will be updated less frequently
than the private repo, because that one is being constantly updated. When
a significant feature is implemented, I will update this folder here on the
Portfolio repository.

Mazefighter is a pure javascript quasi-Rogue-like game which uses the amazing
RotJS library.

Initially I followed along with some notes by Red Blob Games, but I soon
diverged from this as Mazefighter took on a life of its own. I borrowed some of
his ideas as far as partway through section 4 - Field of View, and referred
back to some of his later sections for inspiration and ideas as I went along. I
highly recommend anyone curious about understanding rotjs library to read it -
it is certainly a more current example than others I was able to locate.
