This part of the repo contains my contributions to a group software
engineering school project. It demos a very basic Flask website with a python
interface for DynamoDB.
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
EC2      - Contains my notes to aid my teammates in getting up to speed
           regarding the server setup.

DynamoDB - Contains the code for the demo:
           aws_controller.py has implementations of my methods for database
           interactions.
           db_test.py exercises the methods.
           The other files relate to rendering the page with Flask.
