gta_caballo - A program I wrote for automation of horse betting in GTAV, based
              on the fact that it was initially the most predictably profitable
              game in the casino DLC. Disclaimer: I do not advise anyone to
              actually run this code, because the exploit was patched. It is
              included here for posterity and fun :) It also includes methods
              for automation of bunker research, which may still be potentially
              useful.

wbsg_translator - I wrote this to help people who use the save-game editor for
                  mount and blade warband, after noticing that certain values
                  were difficult to understand. Had I believed that TW would
                  ACTUALLY release bannerlord, I likely would not have
                  bothered. That said, this is a good example of my problem-
                  solving skills, and probably worth a look.

photoducket - That moment when a client informed me that photobucket was holding
              their old photos hostage, I said "I got this. Hold my beer."

simple_encoder - I'm pretty sure I was bored one day...
