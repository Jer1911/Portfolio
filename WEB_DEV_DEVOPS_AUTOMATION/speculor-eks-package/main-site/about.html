	<p style="text-align: center">Speculor Consulting was created to provide cloud infrastructure automation to small businesses. Leveraging diverse DevOps and Systems Engineering experience from over ten years in the Defense and Data Science sectors, we enable customers to deploy robust, secure, customized IT infrastructures in an automated, repeatable, and reliable way. Our infrastructure-as-code approach allows us to programmatically fulfill our customerâ€™s requirements and then hand over the codebase so they can build upon it and use it for future reference. Whether your company is migrating its existing infrastructure to the cloud, or in need of a brand new cloud solution, Speculor Consulting is committed to excellence in engineering and service.</p>

  <h2 style="text-align:center;color:white">Details</h2>
  <p style="text-align:center;color:white">We work with multiple cloud providers and operating systems, and are experts in AWS, Terraform, Kubernetes, Docker, Ansible, Chef, and Linux/Unix-based systems. Our custom solutions build the infrastructure programmatically from the ground up, strictly segregating private and public subnets within the VPC and establishing bastion hosts as a single, hardened point of ingress from the internet. We fully automate the deployment of any kind of web servers and database layers a customer may need, and also secure front-ends with SSL-protected load balancers. All of our deployments utilize high-availability clusters and auto-scaling groups to ensure that your infrastructure can grow alongside your business and is never unavailable. We consider security the foundation of our practice, and accordingly, we provide intensive OS hardening, highly granular IAM policies, strict security group rules, dynamic network access control lists, and automated vulnerability scanning and reporting for all systems that we deploy. For customers requiring next-level security, we also provide penetration testing services and can build infrastructures specialized for such.</p>
